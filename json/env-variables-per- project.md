# Load env variables per project

To do this, you can use the utility [direnv/direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)

It will load needed environment variables, required for the project when you navigate to the project folder

Unfortunately, it does not work in the GoLang IDE, even with this plugin https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19275-better-direnv

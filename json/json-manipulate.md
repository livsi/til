# JSON manipulations

The alternatives for manipulating json:

- [jsonata](https://jsonata.org/) (It was the first library with this capability that I had ever heard of.) Has js and [golang](https://github.com/blues/jsonata-go) implementations.
- [jmespath](https://jmespath.org) is used in the ansible
- [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) Golang implementation for [k8s](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/util/jsonpath) and alternatively [PaesslerAG/jsonpath](https://github.com/PaesslerAG/jsonpath)

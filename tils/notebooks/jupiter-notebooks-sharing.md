# Network alternative to the jupyter notebook

As a network alternative to the jupyter notebook you can use https://colab.research.google.com. Same python, same notebooks, 
and you can share with other people. You can also work with a notebook saved on github

I learned this by following this link https://colab.research.google.com/github/dcmoura/spyql/blob/master/notebooks/json_benchmark.ipynb
